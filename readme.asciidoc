Rtems Kernel Image Project (RKI)
--------------------------------

This project provides a starting point or example of how to configure an RTEMS application for your project. There are many ways to configure an RTEMS application, this project is just something I have done to help me run on various targets. It is put together from different examples I have found, most of which have been contributed by RTEMS developers. 

NOTE: I have tested this on the Raspberry Pi and the SPARC/sis simulator with RTEMS 4.11. I have not tested this project with RTEMS 4.10. I am not sure the RAM disk code will compile and run on RTEMS 4.10.

This project configuration provides:

- RAM Disk setup
- NVRAM Disk setup
- Network setup ( if the target supports it )
- Shell setup and shell startup script
- Example shell commands including whetstone and dhrystone benchmarks
- Makefiles for a couple of targets ( ARM/Raspberry Pi and SPARC/sis simulator )

Each target can be configured and compiled separately. 

How to Configure the RKI image 
------------------------------

For the Raspberry Pi, enter the build-arm-rpi subdirectory. 
For the SPARC/sis simulator target, enter the build-sparc-sis directory.

.Edit these lines in the Makefile
----------------------------------------------
##
## paths for the RTEMS tools and RTEMS BSP
##
RTEMS_TOOL_BASE=/home/alan/Projects/rtems/4.11
RTEMS_BSP_BASE=/home/alan/Projects/rtems/4.11
----------------------------------------------

In addition to the build environment, you can also configure many of the options in the RKI. Take a close look at the following files:

.Config Files
- rtems_config.h
- rki_config.h
- rtems_net_config.h


How to build
------------

.Make sure you have the following set up correctly
- arm-rtems4.11 and/or sparc-rtems4.11 tools installed
- arm/raspberrypi and or sparc/sis BSP compiled and installed
- The paths in the makefile set to the tools and BSP 

You should be able to just type

-------------------------------
$ make 
-------------------------------

to build the executable.

How to run the RKI image
------------------------

Here is how to run the rki program on the SPARC/sis simulator:

.SPARC/sis
-------------------------------------------------
$ make    # build the image
$ ./run-sis.sh
(gdb) target sim
(gdb) load
(gdb) run
-------------------------------------------------

And the Raspberry Pi:

.Raspberry Pi
------------------------------------------------
$ make    # build the image
$ cp rki.bin kernel.img 

( Now copy the kernel.img to your Raspberry Pi SD card. Be sure to back up the old kernel.img! )
------------------------------------------------ 

Commands to try
---------------

When you run the application on a target, you should get the shell prompt. Try some of these commands:

.List all tasks
--------------
# task
--------------

.List all semaphores
-------------------
# sema
-------------------

.Run the Dhrystone benchmark
---------------------------
# dhrystone
---------------------------

.Run the Whetstone benchmark
---------------------------
# whetstone
---------------------------

.Create 5 tasks that run for 10 seconds
---------------------------
# taskdemo
---------------------------

There are quite a few more commands to run, just type

--------------------------
# help
--------------------------

You can also add your own commands, and include a startup script 

Check out what the startup script is doing by typing:

--------------------------
# cat shell-init
--------------------------

In the case of the Raspberry Pi BSP, it formats a 64 Megabyte RAM disk with the RTEMS file system, then mounts the disk on /ram.
