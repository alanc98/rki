 *              on which the distribution of statements etc. is based.
 *
 *              In this C version, the following C library functions are used:
 *              - strcpy, strcmp (inside the measurement loop)
 *              - printf, scanf (outside the measurement loop)
 *              In addition, Berkeley UNIX system calls "times ()" or "time ()"
 *              are used for execution time measurement. For measurements
 *              on other systems, these calls have to be changed.

 *      (number of wait states).
 *      Software information includes: Compiler (and runtime library)
 *      manufacturer and version, compilation switches, OS version.
 *      The Operating System version may give an indication about the

 ***************************************************************************
 *
 *  History:    This version C/2.1 has been made for two reasons:
 *
 *              1) There is an obvious need for a common C version of
 *              Dhrystone, since C is at present the most popular system
 *              programming language for the class of processors
 *              (microcomputers, minicomputers) where Dhrystone is used most.
 *              There should be, as far as possible, only one C version of
 *              Dhrystone such that results can be compared without
 *              restrictions. In the past, the C versions distributed
 *              by Rick Richardson (Version 1.1) and by Reinhold Weicker
 *              had small (though not significant) differences.
 *
 *              2) As far as it is possible without changes to the Dhrystone
 *              statistics, optimizing compilers should be prevented from
 *              removing significant statements.
 *
 *              This C version has been developed in cooperation with
 *              Rick Richardson (Tinton Falls, NJ), it incorporates many
 *              ideas from the "Version 1.1" distributed previously by
 *              him over the UNIX network Usenet.
 *              I also thank Chaim Benedelac (National Semiconductor),
 *              David Ditzel (SUN), Earl Killian and John Mashey (MIPS),
 *              Alan Smith and Rafael Saavedra-Barrera (UC at Berkeley)
 *              for their help with comments on earlier versions of the
 *              benchmark.
 *
 *  Changes:    In the initialization part, this version follows mostly
 *              Rick Richardson's version distributed via Usenet, not the
 *              version distributed earlier via floppy disk by Reinhold Weicker.
 *              As a concession to older compilers, names have been made
 *              unique within the first 8 characters.
 *              Inside the measurement loop, this version follows the
 *              version previously distributed by Reinhold Weicker.
 *
 *              At several places in the benchmark, code has been added,
 *              but within the measurement loop only in branches that 
 *              are not executed. The intention is that optimizing compilers
 *              should be prevented from moving code out of the measurement
 *              loop, or from removing code altogether. Since the statements
 *              that are executed within the measurement loop have NOT been
 *              changed, the numbers defining the "Dhrystone distribution"
 *              (distribution of statements, operand types and locality)
 *              still hold. Except for sophisticated optimizing compilers,
 *              execution times for this version should be the same as
 *              for previous versions.
 *              
 *              Since it has proven difficult to subtract the time for the
 *              measurement loop overhead in a correct way, the loop check
 *              has been made a part of the benchmark. This does have
 *              an impact - though a very minor one - on the distribution
 *              statistics which have been updated for this version.
 *
 *              All changes within the measurement loop are described
 *              and discussed in the companion paper "Rationale for
 *              Dhrystone version 2".
 *
 *              Because of the self-imposed limitation that the order and
 *              distribution of the executed statements should not be
 *              changed, there are still cases where optimizing compilers
 *              may not generate code for some statements. To a certain
 *              degree, this is unavoidable for small synthetic benchmarks.
 *              Users of the benchmark are advised to check code listings
 *              whether code is generated for all statements of Dhrystone.
 *
 *              Version 2.1 is identical to version 2.0 distributed via
 *              the UNIX network Usenet in March 1988 except that it corrects
 *              some minor deficiencies that were found by users of version 2.0.
 *              The only change within the measurement loop is that a
 *              non-executed "else" part was added to the "if" statement in
 *              Func_3, and a non-executed "else" part removed from Proc_3.

 ***************************************************************************
 *
 * Defines:     The following "Defines" are possible:
 *              -DREG=register          (default: Not defined)
 *                      As an approximation to what an average C programmer
 *                      might do, the "register" storage class is applied
 *                      (if enabled by -DREG=register)
 *                      - for local variables, if they are used (dynamically)
 *                        five or more times
 *                      - for parameters if they are used (dynamically)
 *                        six or more times
 *                      Note that an optimal "register" strategy is
 *                      compiler-dependent, and that "register" declarations
 *                      do not necessarily lead to faster execution.
 *              -DNOSTRUCTASSIGN        (default: Not defined)
 *                      Define if the C compiler does not support
 *                      assignment of structures.
 *              -DNOENUMS               (default: Not defined)
 *                      Define if the C compiler does not support
 *                      enumeration types.
 *              -DTIMES                 (default)
 *              -DTIME
 *                      The "times" function of UNIX (returning process times)
 *                      or the "time" function (returning wallclock time)
 *                      is used for measurement. 
 *                      For single user machines, "time ()" is adequate. For
 *                      multi-user machines where you cannot get single-user
 *                      access, use the "times ()" function. If you have
 *                      neither, use a stopwatch in the dead of night.
 *                      "printf"s are provided marking the points "Start Timer"
 *                      and "Stop Timer". DO NOT use the UNIX "time(1)"
 *                      command, as this will measure the total time to
 *                      run this program, which will (erroneously) include
 *                      the time to allocate storage (malloc) and to perform
 *                      the initialization.
 *              -DHZ=nnn
 *                      In Berkeley UNIX, the function "times" returns process
 *                      time in 1/HZ seconds, with HZ = 60 for most systems.
 *                      CHECK YOUR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU JUST APPLY
 *                      A VALUE.

 *
 *  Compilation model and measurement (IMPORTANT):
 *
 *  This C version of Dhrystone consists of three files:
 *  - dhry.h (this file, containing global definitions and comments)
 *  - dhry_1.c (containing the code corresponding to Ada package Pack_1)
 *  - dhry_2.c (containing the code corresponding to Ada package Pack_2)
 *
 *  The following "ground rules" apply for measurements:
 *  - Separate compilation
 *  - No procedure merging
 *  - Otherwise, compiler optimizations are allowed but should be indicated
 *  - Default results are those without register declarations
 *  See the companion paper "Rationale for Dhrystone Version 2" for a more
 *  detailed discussion of these ground rules.
 *
 *  For 16-Bit processors (e.g. 80186, 80286), times for all compilation
 *  models ("small", "medium", "large" etc.) should be given if possible,
 *  together with a definition of these models for the compiler system used.

 *  Dhrystone (C version) statistics:
 *
 *  [Comment from the first distribution, updated for version 2.
 *   Note that because of language differences, the numbers are slightly
 *   different from the Ada version.]
 *
 *  The following program contains statements of a high level programming
 *  language (here: C) in a distribution considered representative:           
 *
 *    assignments                  52 (51.0 %)
 *    control statements           33 (32.4 %)
 *    procedure, function calls    17 (16.7 %)
 *
 *  103 statements are dynamically executed. The program is balanced with
 *  respect to the three aspects:                                             
 *
 *    - statement type
 *    - operand type
 *    - operand locality
 *         operand global, local, parameter, or constant.                     
 *
 *  The combination of these three aspects is balanced only approximately.

 *  The program does not compute anything meaningful, but it is syntactically

 *  before they are used as a source operand.
 *
 *  There has been no explicit effort to account for the effects of a
 *  cache, or to balance the use of long or short displacements for code or
 *  data.

 * Converted by Rich Painter, Painter Engineering, Inc. based on the
 * www.netlib.org benchmark/whetstoned version obtained 16 March 1998.
 *
 * A novel approach was used here to keep the look and feel of the
 * FORTRAN version.  Altering the FORTRAN-based array indices,
 * starting at element 1, to start at element 0 for C, would require
 * numerous changes, including decrementing the variable indices by 1.
 * Instead, the array E1[] was declared 1 element larger in C.  This
 * allows the FORTRAN index range to function without any literal or
 * variable indices changes.  The array element E1[0] is simply never
 * used and does not alter the benchmark results.
 *
 * The major FORTRAN comment blocks were retained to minimize
 * differences between versions.  Modules N5 and N12, like in the
 * FORTRAN version, have been eliminated here.
 *
 * An optional command-line argument has been provided [-c] to
 * offer continuous repetition of the entire benchmark.
 * An optional argument for setting an alternate LOOP count is also
 * provided.  Define PRINTOUT to cause the POUT() function to print
 * outputs at various stages.  Final timing measurements should be
 * made with the PRINTOUT undefined.
